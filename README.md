# Repository Pattern

## A design pattern that isolates the data layer from the rest of the app.

The repository pattern is a design pattern that isolates the data layer from the rest of the app.
The data layer refers to the part of your app, separate from the UI, that handles the app's data and business logic, 
exposing consistent APIs for the rest of your app to access this data.
